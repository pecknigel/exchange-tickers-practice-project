# Exchange Tickers Practice Project

This repository is provided for students looking to work on a data service to generate fake trading price tickers representing active markets.

It’s part of the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/)

Technologies Used:

- JavaScript or TypeScript
- Node.js
- Command Line Scripts

You’ll create a program with a command line interface that generates trading price data that changes over time.

## How it Looks

The output from your program will be a simple line of text that provides the prices for each symbol.

```
ATD: 34.69423688, DBH: 78.942689447
```

## How it Works

Choose whether to create your project using JavaScript or TypeScript.

You’ll need Node.js installed in order to run your script.

More information will be provided here soon, as we work with students on this project.

To learn what you need to complete this project, check out our [Courses and Resources](https://docs.prescriptionfree.academy/resources) page.

Ongoing support and guided learning is available from Nigel via the [main website](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

## Existing Implementation

There is an existing implementation of this project at:

Open Exchange Tickers  
[GitHub - pecknigel/open-exchange-tickers](https://github.com/pecknigel/open-exchange-tickers)

Rather than create your own implementation of this project, you may want to get involved in adding features to the existing implementation.

## Tasks
